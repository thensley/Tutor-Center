Here are some examples of the queries we'll most likely be using. These 
are NOT finalized, and don't take into account the names of the variables 
we'll actually be using on the site. Here for reference for the moment.


INSERT INTO tutorsched (apptID, days, endTime, startTime, userID) VALUES ($apptID, $days[], $startTime, $endTime, $user_userID)

DELETE FROM tutorsched WHERE apptID=$apointmentID
 
DELETE FROM login WHERE userID=$userID
 
INSERT INTO login (admin, password, userID, username) VALUES (false, $pass, $ID, $username)
 
UPDATE tutorsched SET days=$days, startTime=$start, endTime=$end WHERE userID=$ID
